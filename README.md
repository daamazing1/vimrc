My Amazing Vim configuration

Environment
=====
This is the configuration I use on my windows machines.  

The Cool
=====
Vim UNDO/SWAP/BACKUP files are stored under the user profile.  This was done so
editing files on a share don't cause issue and you always have the UNDO on your
machine locally, just in case.

The gVim GUI has all menus and status bars removed, this was done so that it
looks more like terminal VIM.

My favorite plugins have been installed soem via Vundle and some manually
because no Vundle package exists.

Keymappings to move around splits and buffers, makes working on large projects
with multiple files open easier to get around.

Attempted to get the console version of VIM to act like gVIM, mostly all there
minus airline which Windows console will not allow for teh modified fonts. So,
airline fonts are turned off on the console.
